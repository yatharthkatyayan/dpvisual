## Acknowledgement

* This project is inspired from [Recursion Tree Visualizer](https://github.com/brpapa/recursion-tree-visualizer).

* To positionate each node of the tree on 2D plane in an aesthetically pleasing way, I implemented the Reingold-Tilford's algorithm. Thanks to:

  * [Drawing Presentable Trees](https://llimllib.github.io/pymag-trees/#foot5)
